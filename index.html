        Woody and the gang go on a road trip with new toy Forky, who's convinced
        he's trash and doesn't yet understand his role in the world. Along the
        way, Woody is unexpectedly reunited with independent spirit Bo Peep and
        finds himself faced with a decision, and a future, he never imagined.

            He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy named
            Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody served as
            the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by looking out for
            each member of the group. When Andy enters adulthood and leaves for
            college, Woody is donated to a little girl named Bonnie Anderson. He
            remains with Bonnie for some time, before choosing to become an
            owner-less antique devoted to helping lost toys find owners,
            alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.

            An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he
            doesn’t belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he tries
            to get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure he’d rather
            skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable spork, so
            he’s facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as a spork,
            but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.”

            He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis.
            Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were especially
            popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy Story
            created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody, though this
            rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

            Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing a
            calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed. She is noted for
            using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and bring him closer
            in a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal more daring with
            her words and actions, which Woody seems to be quite fond of. She
            and her sheep were bought along with the lamp not too long after
            Molly was born, due to the baby being scared of the dark, which
            "broke every toy's heart", according to Woody. The lamp comforted
            Molly and she would often have her hand lay on Bo's feet.
